Player Movement Spec (Bell's Shadow) - GameCube Pad

Goal: Smooth 8-way walk with accel and decel. No combat yet.

Controls:
- GameCube left stick moves the player
- GameCube A button interacts

Input rules:
- Read left stick X and Y each frame
- Build a direction vector from stick values
- Deadzone 0.15 so tiny stick noise does nothing
- Normalize diagonal so it is not faster

Speeds:
- Walk speed 3.5 units per second
- Acceleration 8 units per second squared
- Deceleration 10 units per second squared
- Clamp max velocity to walk speed

States:
- Idle to Move when stick magnitude > deadzone
- Move to Idle when stick magnitude <= deadzone and velocity ~ 0

Facing:
- Face the last nonzero move direction
- If velocity is zero keep last facing

Collision:
- Collide with hub walls and props
- Stay within hub bounds

Camera:
- Follow player with light lag 0.15 seconds later

TODO in order:
1. Read GameCube left stick input
2. Apply deadzone and normalize direction
3. Compute target velocity = direction * walk speed
4. Move current velocity toward target using accel and decel
5. Move character and resolve collisions
6. Update facing to match movement
7. If A is pressed near Slayer Master, print Interact for now
8. Debug print position, velocity, state each frame
